# AI Paradigms and AI Safety:
### Mapping Artefacts and Techniques to Safety Issues

*Paper submitted for publication*

In this work, we present a structured approach for thinking about paradigms in AI and use this as the basis for empirical analysis of how AI safety issues have been explored in the research literature so far. 

We define **paradigms** in AI more precisely, drawing on literature in the philosophy of science to distinguish two different types of paradigms in AI: **artefacts** and **techniques**. Drawing on existing research and the expertise of several AI and AI safety researchers, we outline a preliminary taxonomy of ten different AI artefacts. 

We also map how these different artefacts relate to AI safety issues. 

We use experimental data of research and media documents from AI topics, an official publication of the AAAI, to conduct a more grounded empirical analysis of the historical evolution of these different AI [tecniques](https://github.com/nandomp/AIParadigmsSafety/blob/master/AI%20topics%20tags/mapping-techniques.csv) and [artefacts](https://github.com/nandomp/AIParadigmsSafety/blob/master/AI%20topics%20tags/mapping-artefacts.csv), and the [safety issues](https://github.com/nandomp/AIParadigmsSafety/blob/master/AI%20topics%20tags/mapping-safetyissues.csv) associated with them. 

Our analysis identifies a number of gaps in AI safety research where certain combinations of techniques, paradigms and safety issues need to be addressed. We conclude the paper by discussing implications for future research in AI safety.
